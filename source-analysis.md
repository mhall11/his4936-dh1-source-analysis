## Basic Source Information

* Where is your source located (URL? Or traditional media)
<p>https://pharaoh.se/obelisks</p>
* What kind of source is it? (Diaries, records of objects, data tables, etc...)
<p>The website is a list of a obelisks and their locations. The rest of the site is devoted to giving and presenting translations for the pharaohs' names.</p>
* Who, or what organization, is responsible for hosting the source (if online), who gathered the information?
<p>The website is hosted and curated by Peter Lungstrom.</p>

## Authorship

* Is there any information available discussing the process by which the information was gathered, or how the digital project was constructed?
<p>The creator of the website outright mentions that the website was created out of his own free time. He states he is not an Egyptologist and made this website to gather information about pharaohs for his own reasons.</p>
* How transparent is the project about the choices they made in gathering and transforming the data for digitalization? [Click here for an example of a an excellent 'About' page from a database about Anglo-Saxons](http://www.pase.ac.uk/about/index.html)
<p>Lungstrom states that he tried his best to stay within the consensus of the scholarship when it comes to the dating and placing the pharaohs within the timeline. He dictates is reasoning for the website as to give the hieroglyphic names. This portion of the website does not very accurately depict the gathering of the information of the obelisks or other items outside the pharaoh names and does not seem to explain his methodology.</p>
* Do the organizations or individuals involved in gathering and publishing your data set have any stated goals or agendas?
<p>Lungstrom's stated goal is to create a website with the hieroglyphic names of the pharaohs and to understand what their names mean. His website has since branched out past that without a stated goal.<p>
* Do the organizations or individuals involved seem to have any unstated agendas or goals?
<p>Though Lunstrom mentions that he created this site to give people access to certain information not always available, he also seems interested in moving this past just information about the pharaohs. The site is a pet project that Lungstrom works on in his free time and likely funded through his own money. The information is mostly facts like the hieroglyphic names and the locations and movements of obelisks. There's not much synthesis or analysis, mostly just collection. Any analysis or synthesis is from scholars that he cites.</p>
* If a 3rd party funded the project, who are they? Do they have any particular perspective?
<p>The funding is unstated, but is very likely from Peter Lungstrom's own personal finances. This would indicate that the site's goals and perspectives are exclusively his or the ones of those he cites.</p>

## Data Analysis

* Do the datasets involved reflect the viewpoints of particular groups or institutions, and if so, who?
<p>The datasets reflect the viewpoints of the consensus of the scholarship as according to Lungstrom.</p>
* What kinds of categorizations do you find in the data, and do they seem reasonable?
<p>The data, especially the pharaoh names, are given in chronological and succession order. The obelisks are in no particular order, it seems. The only categorization for the obelisks is where they stand today, but even this does not place the obelisks in chronological or alphabetical by location order. This is frustrating to say the least for trying to gather information is an easy fashion for the obelisks.</p>
* Do the means of data collection or categorization affect how the data is constructed in any way?
<p>Speaking purely on the section about obelisks, it makes trying to gleam data in a meaningful way to follow trends nearly impossible. It creates a somewhat confusing presentation for the data, though the actual construction of the site puts all the information in neat boxes, which makes things slightly better.</p>
* Does the website contain any tools for visualizing the data? Do they seem like they are making any kind of arguments?
<p>It does not contain any tolls for visualization of data. They are not making a true argument outside of attempting to present the consensus of the scholarship to their particular knowledge.</p>
